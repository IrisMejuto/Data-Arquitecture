## 1. Hadoop Cluster Setup (GCP)

### Cluster creation in Dataproc  
Setup of a Hadoop cluster using **Dataproc** on Google Cloud Platform. Configuration included number of nodes, Hadoop version, and network settings.

### Bucket creation in Google Cloud Storage  
A bucket was created to store required JAR files for ElasticSearch integration.

### Uploading JAR files to the bucket  
Upload of the following JAR files into the bucket via GCP Console:

- `elasticsearch-hadoop-x.x.x.jar`
- Additional compatibility JARs for Hive integration

### Transferring JAR files to the cluster  
Files were copied from the bucket to the Hadoop cluster nodes using:

```bash
gsutil cp gs://bucket-elastic-pr/commons-httpclient-3.1.jar .

gsutil cp gs://bucket-elastic-pr/elasticsearch-hadoop-8.14.1.jar .
